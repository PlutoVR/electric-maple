# Deps Readme

The gstreamer_android deps are fetched by running the
../download_gst.sh script. The gstreamer version we're using is
version 1.22.6 which contains all the fixes we need.

For any additional fixes or build customization: Manually clone the
gstreamer_android repo with CERBERO
<https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/building-from-source-using-cerbero.html?gi-language=c>
and build for arm64 following the instructions.
